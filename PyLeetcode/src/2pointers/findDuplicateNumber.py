Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

/**
 * Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
 *
 * Proof:
 *   start-----entry-------
 *               |        |
 *               --------meeting point
 *   x: distance from start to entry
 *   y: distance from entry to meeting point
 *   c: cycle length
 *
 *   When tortoise and hare meets at meeting point,
 *     tortoise traveled: x + y,
 *     hare traveled: x + y + n*c (which is x + y + several loops inside the circle)
 *
 *   And hare is twice faster than tortoise, so
 *     2(x + y) = x + y + n*c
 *
 *   Then we can get
 *     x = n*c - y
 *     x = (n-1)*c + (c-y)
 *
 *   Which means
 *     traveling from start to entry (distance is x) and
 *     traveling from meeting point to entry (c-y + several loops in circle)
 *     will finally meet at entry
